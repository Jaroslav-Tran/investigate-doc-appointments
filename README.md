# Investigate doctor appointments in Brasil
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project-Analyzing Doc Appointments in Brasil

## SUMMARY
In this project I investigate a dataset called no show appointments. The goal was to practice my newly acquired Data Analytics skills from Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree by analyzing the doctor appointment dataset in Brasil available from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments

## INTRODUCTION:
This dataset collects information from over 100k medical appointments in Brazil and 14 associated variables (characteristics). It is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

1) PatientId: Identification of a patient
2) AppointmentID: Identification of each appointment
3) Gender: Male or Female . Female is the greater proportion, women take way more care of they health in comparison to man.
4) ScheduledDay: The day of the actuall appointment, when they have to visit the doctor.
5) AppointmentDay: The day someone called or registered the appointment, this is before appointment of course.
6) Age: How old is the patient.
7) Neighbourhood: Where the appointment takes place.
9) Scholarship: True of False. Observation, this is a broad topic, consider reading this article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia
10) Hipertension: True or False.
11) Diabetes: True or False.
12) Alcoholism: True or False.
13) Handcap: True or False.
14) SMS_received: True or False: 1 or more messages sent to the patient.
15) No-show> True (Did not show up) or False (Showed up).
